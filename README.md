# [WIP] rss-tg-bot 
Bot which allows using Telegram as RSS reader

# :dog:	 This is a pet-project
So don't expect much from it. It is being developed in a spare time to see 
if Telegram could be used as a suitable (for me) replacement for RSS reader 
apps. It might lack some tests, architecture patterns, and any other 
state-of-the-art programming stuff.
